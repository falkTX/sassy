Preface
-------

I got interested in music and musical instruments about a decade ago,
when my child got his first toy piano. Amazing what a little bit
of boredom can do. A decade later I have a couple thousand euros worth 
of keyboards, VSTs, and synthesizers. Oops.

It was inevitable for me to look at modular synthesis. When I was
finishing up the Atanua logic simulator project I pondered about using
it as a basis for a synthesizer, but that never ended up anywhere.
Back then I did get the idea of using a spreadsheet as the basis of
audio generation.

As I'm writing this, a month ago or so I played around with vcvrack,
and got inspired to write my own. I played around with a couple graph 
editors written for ImGui, and then figured that I could give that
spreadsheet idea a shot.

Two days later I had my first, minimally working version.
